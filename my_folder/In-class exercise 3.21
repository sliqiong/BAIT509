1. Both are predicted to have the same productivity score of 75, but have the following probabilistic forecasts.

Candidate A has high likelihood of getting 75 productivity score while candidate B has relatively low likelihood of getting 75 productivity score.  The productivity performance has high variance for candidate B, while in contrast, candidate A has a relatively stable productivity performance centered with 75. We are taking less risk hiring candidate A. Meanwhile, it is equally possible for B to achieve 80 productivity socres and 70 productivity scores. 

2. Two “non-overlapping” forecasts.

Candidate A has a relatively stable productivity performance around 60 productivity scores with low variance. Candidate B has a high productivity score of 80. However, candidate B has higher variance and an equal likelihood of getting 70 and 90 productivity scores. In conclusion, candidate B is preferred than candidate A as A's worst productivity is higher than candidate B's best performance. 

3. You’ve formed a probabilistic forecast for a particular value of the predictors, displayed below as a density. You then collect test data for that same value of the predictor, indicated as the points below the density. What is the problem with the probabilistic forecast?

The probabilistic forecast is biased because the test data for the same value of the predictor are not centered around zero, which is indicated by the forecast density curve. Reducing the K helps to correct the bias.
