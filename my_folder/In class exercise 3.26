6 In-class exercises

1.	Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has x1=6x1=6 and x2=10x2=10?

I will classify the new observation as A according to the rule that it is to the right of the decision boundary which is classification A.

2.	What size is the margin here?
According to the plot, the margin size is 2.

3.	Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
Observation 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will receive penalty, and also they are the support vectors as they are the only ones to contribute to a penalty.

4.	What is the total penalty here?  (the proportion of the margin)
0.25 + 0.25 + 1.75 + 2.25 + 1.25 = 5.75

5.	Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?
It depends. 
With the increase of margin width from 0, the penalty starts to decrease at first and then start to increase.

6.	Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
Yes, the support vectors are 4, 8 and 9.
